### Hardware

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. Arduino senses the environment by receiving inputs from many sensors, and affects its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators.
- [BeagleBoard](http://beagleboard.org/) - The BeagleBoard is a low-power open-source hardware single-board computer produced by Texas Instruments in association with Digi-Key and Newark element14. The BeagleBoard was also designed with open source software development in mind, and as a way of demonstrating the Texas Instrument's OMAP3530 system-on-a-chip.
- [Intel Galileo](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/galileo-maker-quark-board.html) - The Intel® Galileo Gen 2 board is the first in a family of Arduino*-certified development and prototyping boards based on Intel® architecture and specifically designed for makers, students, educators, and DIY electronics enthusiasts.
- [Microduino](https://www.microduino.cc/) - Microduino and mCookie bring powerful, small, stackable electronic hardware to makers, designers, engineers, students and curious tinkerers of all ages. Build open-source projects or create innovative new ones.
- [Node MCU (ESP 8266)](http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html) - NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. It uses the Lua scripting language. It is based on the eLua project, and built on the ESP8266 SDK 0.9.5. It uses many open source projects, such as lua-cjson, and spiffs. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module.
- [Particle](https://www.particle.io) - A suite of hardware and software tools to help you
prototype, scale, and manage your Internet of Things products.
- [Pinoccio](https://pinocc.io/) - Pinoccio is a pocket-sized, wireless sensor and microcontroller board that combines the features of an Arduino Mega board with a ZigBee compatible 2.4GHz radio. It also includes components for IoT application development, such as an RGB LED and a micro-SD card slot.
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.
- [Tessel](https://tessel.io/) - Tessel is a completely open source and community-driven IoT and robotics development platform. It encompases development boards, hardware module add-ons, and the software that runs on them. Tessel is about designing intuitive and accessible hardware development experiences around the open web.

### Software

#### Operating systems

 - [ARM mbed](http://www.mbed.com/) - The ARM® mbed™ IoT Device Platform provides the operating system, cloud services, tools and developer ecosystem to make the creation and deployment of commercial, standards-based IoT solutions possible at scale.
 - [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org/) - Contiki is an open source operating system for the Internet of Things. Contiki connects tiny low-cost, low-power microcontrollers to the Internet.
 - [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/) - FreeRTOS is a popular real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices, that has been ported to 35 microcontrollers.
 - [Google Brillo](https://developers.google.com/brillo/) - Brillo extends the Android platform to all your connected devices, so they are easy to set up and work seamlessly with each other and your smartphone.
 - [Raspbian](https://raspbian.org/) - Raspbian is a free operating system based on Debian optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware.
 - [RIOT](http://www.riot-os.org/) - The friendly Operating System for the Internet of Things.
 - [Tiny OS](http://www.tinyos.net/) - TinyOS is an open source, BSD-licensed operating system designed for low-power wireless devices, such as those used in sensor networks, ubiquitous computing, personal area networks, smart buildings, and smart meters.

#### Frameworks

 - [Eclipse Smarthome](https://eclipse.org/smarthome/) - The Eclipse SmartHome framework is designed to run on embedded devices, such as a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone Black or an Intel Edison. It requires a Java 7 compliant JVM and an OSGi (4.2+) framework, such as Eclipse Equinox.
 - [Kura](https://eclipse.org/kura/) - Kura aims at offering a Java/OSGi-based container for M2M applications running in service gateways. Kura provides or, when available, aggregates open source implementations for the most common services needed by M2M applications. Kura components are designed as configurable OSGi Declarative Service exposing service API and raising events. While several Kura components are in pure Java, others are invoked through JNI and have a dependency on the Linux operating system.
 - [Mihini](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Mihini) - The main goal of Mihini is to deliver an embedded runtime running on top of Linux, that exposes high-level API for building M2M applications. Mihini aims at enabling easy and portable development, by facilitating access to the I/Os of an M2M system, providing a communication layer, etc.
 - [OpenHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) - The openHAB runtime is a set of OSGi bundles deployed on an OSGi framework (Equinox). It is therefore a pure Java solution and needs a JVM to run. Being based on OSGi, it provides a highly modular architecture, which even allows adding and removing functionality during runtime without stopping the service.
